    If you want to enter the key to the application by the file, you just need to choose the file with ".txt" extension, which contains three or two lines. Every line should start with "n=", "e=", or "d=". After that, the line should contains the right part of the key (look at the key generated by the software). You can also load only two numbers (f.e. only e and n) by the same way, just remember, that you need to put number n before number e, if you want to load public key.
        When your're choosing file to encrypt, remember that, if you chose "text" below "encrypt" button then you can encrypt files with ".txt" extension. If you chose "image", you can encrypt files with ".jpg" extension and if you chose "Other file" you can chose every other extension.
