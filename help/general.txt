To safely sent an important information from some computer A to computer B, you need to:
1. Have this program on both computers.
2. Generate a key on computer B (the best option is to chose 2048 as the key's length).
3. Sent a number n and e from computer B to A. These numbers are called "The public key",
you can safely share them with anyone.
4. Encrypt the information on computer A using numbers n and e from computer B.
5. Sent encrypted information to computer B.
6. Decrypt information on computer B using numbers n and d.

Important: never share the number d. On this number is based the security of the encryption.
It's impossible to decrypt an encrypted information without this number,
it would take billions of years. That's why this algorithm is safe.
