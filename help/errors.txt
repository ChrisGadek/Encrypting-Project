Sometimes during encryption it would occur some errors. This application is still in beta version, so I'm looking for mistakes. If during encryption or decryption the application shuts down or strange things happen, then it would means, that file is not enabled to encrypt, but not always. Sometimes in the application occurs thread error, then you just need to try start encryption again.
