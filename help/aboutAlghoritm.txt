    This software bases on the RSA algorithm, which is one of the most popular and safest asymmetric algorithm on the world. It's based on the problem of factorisation big numbers. The Key, generated by this software, contains three numbers: Number n, e and d.
    All theese numbers came from not very complex processing, which starts with generating a big prime numbers and processing them by modular arithmetic.
    You can compare "private key" (numbers n and d) to a key, and "public key" (numbers n and e) to a padlock. To get information on safely way you just have to send "padlock" (public key) to second person, which uses this "padlock" to lock your information. No one would be able to open the information, because you never share your "key" (private key) to the "padlock". That's why this algorithm is great.
